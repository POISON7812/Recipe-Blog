# Recipe-Blog
A simple HTML website showcasing a collection of sweet recipes, presented in a blog-post style format. This project demonstrates basic HTML structure and styling, with a touch of subtle animations to enhance the user experience. No frameworks or libraries were used, making it a great example of what can be achieved with pure HTML and CSS. Feel free to explore, learn, and indulge in the sweet treats!

Let me know if you'd like me to make any changes!
